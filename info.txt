HEADLINE:

Howdy, I'm Trey! I'm a fullstack developer with a love for building worthwhile projects.

BIO:

    I'm a recent graduate of the Fullstack bootcamp from Thinkful. I also have an experienced background in Film and Digital
Media, specialized in video post-production. My creativity and analytical background keep me drawn to software development.
I love debugging and problem solving, and chase the overwhelming reliefe and joy you get when that problem code begins to 
just work. I geek out over organized, simple, and truly semantic projects, and love the feeling of creating something worthwhile. 

    When i'm not practicing my javascript, or studying the latest language update I like to spend my time traveling and practicing photography 
and videography. When i'm not traveling I love to spend my time with my amazing pupper, gaming and enjoying a really good cup of coffee.

PROJECTS:
                Need to Include:
                    --Project Title 
                    --Project Description

                    --Link to Repo


    Quiz App:
        --> Description: 
                - This project showcases my ability to create a working web app. The questions in this app revolve around space and the knowledge 
                the user possesses of that topic. The design of this was meant to be simplistic and resemble a terminal. The purpose of this was to create 
                an app that had style but had ease of use and was extremly accessible. The code features clean semantic lines and easy to understand JavaScript
                functions. Test it out and see how you do!
                 
        -->Technologies:
            -   HTML5
            -   CSS
            -   JavaScript
            -   jQuery

        -->Repo Link:   https://github.com/TreyTiller/quizapp


DESIGN:

    --> I want the design to be simplistic but content rich. The mobile design will have no menu but will
    lead you through the site all the way down to my contact info. The styling will feature my personal 
    photography and will use a series of contrasting opacity and overlays to differentiate main content
    and menus etc.
        Each project will have smaller screenshots of the working site and will include a description, 
    live repo and the icons of languages used.
        When the site gets to full size things like proficient languages and social media icons will 
    be used on pages like the contact and projects.
        I aim for the design to be a mixture of the two noted in the design doc
